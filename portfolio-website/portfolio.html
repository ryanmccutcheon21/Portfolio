	<h2>About me</h2>
	<p id="aboutMe">Originally a baseball player my entire life, the sport took me to college at the University of Arkansas Fort-Smith where I earned a Bachelor's of Science in Criminal Justice. After graduation, I met and married my wife, who was expecting our first child. It was time to find a job. I ended up getting hired by the Fort Smith Fire Department. I have enjoyed my job, but my passion is designing and developing web and mobile apps. I am extremely motivated and self-taught. I will use my internal drive and passion and apply it towards building the website, or app, of your dreams.</p>
